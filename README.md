# Complated-Django-website TOTEMBO
I have written the full backend of the store template called Totembo.
I have successfully developed a complete and fully functional Django website. It features dynamic content management, secure user authentication, and a responsive design. This project demonstrates my expertise in building scalable and production-ready web applications.
